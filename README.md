# HeartFailurePredictor-CS4641

### **Machine Learning Project for CS4641 - Predicting Heart Failure**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting heart failure using a comprehensive dataset.

### Project Overview

Our goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist in the early identification of individuals at risk of heart failure. To achieve this, we employ machine learning techniques and data analysis learned in the course.

### Project Proposal

We utilize the "Heart Failure Clinical Records" dataset available on Kaggle:

**Dataset Link:** [Heart Failure Clinical Records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data)

### Repository Structure

Here's an overview of the repository structure:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and data preprocessing scripts.
- `enviornment`: Lists project dependencies and step-by-step instructions on how to setup project enviornment.
- `models/`: Stores model architectures and training scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and training.
- `src/`: Code for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and utilities.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HeartFailurePredictor-CS4641.git
cd HeartFailurePredictor-CS4641
```

2. Follow instructions in `enviornment/enviornment_setup.md` to get project dependencies.

### Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the authors of the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset on Kaggle for making their data available for research and analysis.
